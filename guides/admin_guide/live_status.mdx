The Live Status feature provides real-time visibility into the online presence of users within the platform. When users log in to their tally, whether through remote login or HTML login, they can view their current statusâ€”indicating whether they are online or offline.

For users logging into their tally, this feature offers instant insight into their own online status. It allows them to gauge their availability within the platform and ensure seamless communication with colleagues.
