## Introduction

In the "Reset Password" section, users can conveniently update their account passwords directly within the portal. This streamlined process begins with users accessing the designated section typically found within their account settings. Upon entering this section, users are prompted to provide their current or old password as a security measure to verify their identity. Once the old password is confirmed, users proceed to input their desired new password into the designated field.
