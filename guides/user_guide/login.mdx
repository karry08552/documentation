<Note>
Instance Users should not sign up directly. If they attempt to sign up, they will be logged in as an Admin User, not an Instance User.
</Note>


Only Admin Users have the authority to create accounts for Instance Users. Upon account 
creation, the credentials will be sent to the Instance User's email address. Instance Users cannot 
sign up directly; they must receive login details from the Admin User to access the platform.
