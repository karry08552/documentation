## Introduction

The User and Roles section of the Partner Portal provides comprehensive tools for partners to manage their internal team members, such as salesmen and relationship managers. This section enables partners to create, assign, and manage roles effectively, ensuring that customers receive dedicated support whenever needed.

## Role of Users

### Salesperson
A salesperson is like a key player. They're chosen by the partner to be the face of the company, selling its products or services directly to customers. Their job is to talk to potential clients, understand what they want, and explain why the company's offerings are a great fit for them. By doing this well, salespeople help the partner's business grow, build strong relationships with customers, and make sure the partnership is successful overall.

### Salesperson Manager
A salesperson manager is like a team leader. They supervise a group of salespeople, providing guidance and support to help them succeed. Their job is to assign tasks, track progress, and make sure everyone is working together smoothly. By leading their team effectively, salesperson managers help boost sales and reach business goals.
