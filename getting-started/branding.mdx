## Introduction

The Branding section of the Partner Portal provides partners with the tools to customize their brand identity within the portal. This feature is particularly beneficial for partners operating under a white label arrangement, allowing them to create a unique and cohesive brand experience for their customers. 

## White label Status

To access the branding customization features, partners need to have white label status. This status is available for an additional fee. Partners interested in upgrading to white label status can contact their account manager or support team for more details and pricing information.
