<Note>
Partners can't create their accounts on their own.
</Note>

The Login section of the Partner Portal is designed to provide partners with secure and straightforward access to their accounts. Unlike traditional account creation processes, partners do not need to create their accounts independently. Instead, our company facilitates the creation of all partner accounts, ensuring a seamless onboarding experience.
