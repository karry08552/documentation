## Introduction

CoCloud's portal simplifies assigning and changing subscriptions for salespersons, optimizing management and tracking of customer accounts. After logging in at www.partners.cocloud.in, partners can assign subscriptions by navigating to the Subscriptions section. Use the Search Icon to filter by Customer SUBID or other criteria such as Start Date, Billing Dates, Company, Email, and more. Once the subscription is located, clicking on SUBID opens the Subscription dashboard. In the Subscriptions Options, the Update button next to “Salesperson” allows selection from a dropdown list. Submit the changes to assign or reassign the salesperson, ensuring accurate tracking and efficient management of sales responsibilities.
