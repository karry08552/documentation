## Introduction
The Service Request section of the Partner Portal serves as a centralized hub for partners to raise and manage requests for assistance or support. This feature facilitates effective communication between partners and the support team, ensuring that any issues or difficulties encountered while using the portal or managing customers and subscriptions are promptly addressed.


## Tickets to Cocloud (Comhard)
Partners can effortlessly raise service requests whenever they encounter difficulties or require assistance:

Initiating a Request: Partners access the Service Request section and submit details about the issue they are facing or the assistance they require.
Submitting Details: Partners provide a comprehensive description of the problem, along with any relevant information to facilitate swift resolution.
Ticket to CoCloud: If the issue requires escalation or specialized assistance beyond the scope of regular support, partners can escalate the ticket to CoCloud for expert guidance and resolution.
