## Introduction
The Service Request section of the Partner Portal serves as a centralized hub for partners to raise and manage requests for assistance or support. This feature facilitates effective communication between partners and the support team, ensuring that any issues or difficulties encountered while using the portal or managing customers and subscriptions are promptly addressed.


## Tickets to Cocloud
Partners can effortlessly raise service requests whenever they encounter difficulties or require assistance:

Initiating a Request: Partners access the Service Request section and submit details about the issue they are facing or the assistance they require.
Submitting Details: Partners provide a comprehensive description of the problem, along with any relevant information to facilitate swift resolution.
Ticket to CoCloud: If the issue requires escalation or specialized assistance beyond the scope of regular support, partners can escalate the ticket to CoCloud for expert guidance and resolution.

## Tickets from customer
In addition to raising their own service requests, partners can manage tickets raised by their customers, enhancing support and satisfaction:

Customer-generated Tickets: Partners have visibility into tickets raised by their customers, enabling proactive support and swift issue resolution.
Resolving Customer Issues: Partners can prioritize and address customer-generated tickets promptly, fostering strong customer relationships and loyalty.
