## Introduction

The Subscriptions section of the Partner Portal offers an organized view of all customer subscriptions, categorized as paid, trial, upcoming renewals, and expired. Partners and sales personnel can search subscriptions using various criteria like start date, billing date, company email, and plan name. The search results display detailed information, including Subscription ID, Company Name, Phone Number, Plan Name, Unit Price, Number of Users, Amount, Start Date, Next Billing Date, Last Billing Date, Status, and Stage. By clicking on the Subscription ID, users can log in to the customer portal to manage user numbers, delete or suspend subscriptions, update customer emails, and convert trial plans to paid plans, ensuring efficient and comprehensive subscription management.
